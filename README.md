# foundation_landing_page

# I need 6 sections, including header, website top, info section, quote section, call to action, footer

# Header has been made. Taking things one step at a step is best. trying to do more than one thing results in confusion and cross calucaltiosn that jumple everything up. Uploading to git again.
 # cross referencing with previous code helps tremendously and even someitmes does all the work for me.

# font is roboto. Moving onto hero section.
